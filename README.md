# CoinOutlet.co.uk

This project is an MVP for a Cryptocurrency - Pound Sterling brokerage site.  It was built primarily using Ruby on Rails on the backend and Javascript (jQuery) on the front end.  It is hosted on heroku and can be found at www.coinoutlet.co.uk

### Business Model

CoinOutlet was conceived when I noticed a premium for the GBP - BTC currency pairing compared to USD - BTC or EUR - BTC pairings.  I set up a cycle of capital which minimized fees, purchasing BTC for EURO and then selling it for GBP.  The business was validated on a third party site and resulted in a daily return on investment of around 2%.  In order to further reduce fees and offer a wider range of currencies, I decided to create my own platform - www.coinoutlet.co.uk.
